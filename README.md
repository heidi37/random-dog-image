# Random Dog Photo

This was a code challenge on an Udemy Course, [The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/?couponCode=ST13MT40224).

I am currently learning more backend development. This course starts with the older technique of making server requests with a XMLHttpRequest.
